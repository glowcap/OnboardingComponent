### Description
This is designed for standard onboarding with some nice options to customize it to better match any project you're working on. Here are some of the key features!
* Dynamically creates pagination based on the number of models used
* Pagination dots can be resized and colored as needed
* Pagination dots can be exchanged for images (template mode)
* "Back" and "Skip" buttons already built in and ready to use

With all this functionality, you'll be racing past onboarding to get into the 🍖 of the application!

### Installation
As with all of our components, you'll need [Component](#) and [OSViewController](#) if you want any chance of getting this stuff to work. Just drop it in a "Shared" folder and you're good to go.

For this specific component, you'll also need to install the following frameworks with Carthage.

#### Required frameworks
* [RxSwift](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxSwift)
* [SnapKit](https://github.com/SnapKit/SnapKit)
* [NSObject-Rx](https://github.com/RxSwiftCommunity/NSObject-Rx)
* [Quick](https://github.com/Quick/Quick)

Whew!😅💦 Now that those are all in place, you're ready to go!
